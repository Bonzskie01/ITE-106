Phonebook System - README
Overview
The Phonebook System is a simple Java application that allows users to manage their contacts. It provides functionalities such as adding, searching, deleting, and updating contacts. The contact data is stored in a text file (phonebook.txt) on the system. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing to facilitate interaction with users.

Features:
- Add Contact: Allows users to input a name and phone number, and store them in a file.
- Search Contact: Enables users to search for a contact by name.
- Delete Contact: Allows users to delete a contact by name.
- Update Contact: Enables users to update the phone number of an existing contact.
- Data Persistence: Contacts are stored in a text file (phonebook.txt), so data is retained even when the program is closed.

- Java Version: The program is built using Java and requires Java 8 or higher to run.
